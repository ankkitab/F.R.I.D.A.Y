It uses android speech recognition api to analyze the speech input and perform the intended tasks. The main focus group for the application consist of people who are busy with their professional and personal engagements and want a hands-free solution for managing their daily tasks.

How to Test
--------------------------------------------------
For first time users, upon installing the app, they are presented with a tutorial which walks the user through the features provided on how to use the app. 

Features - 
1) Note taking - Use command "Take a note, create a note, make a note". Just ensure to include the keyword 'NOTE'! The user can then create a note, add a title to it and save it. It'll get added to the list of notes which can be EDITED and DELETED as per the user's choice. 
2) Setting reminders - Use command 'Set a reminder', 'REMINDER' being the keyword here. The user can create an event and it automatically gets added to their Google calender. 
3) Maintaining checklists - Commands here would be 'check' and 'uncheck' which lets the user maintain a checklist.
